# MLB_Scraper
Web Scraper of baseball-reference.com for MLB players stats.

## Description
What I have found is that it is very difficult to get all of the stats for every single player on an MLB team roster without having to go through a lot of different pages. 

What this scraper will do is allow the user to input a Professional Baseball team and will look up the roster for that team. Then after the roster is found the scraper will find all of the stats for every single player on the roster. The user will then have the option to export all of the information into an Excel spreadsheet to have on their local machine.
